<!--<p>It has been approximately 2 days since the outbreak started.</p><p> My friend Barry was lucky enough to have gone to Hawaii on vacation a day before the outbreak.</p><p>Somehow the cell towers weren't affected, so now Barry is pretty much the only person I trust right now.</p><p> The town was evacuated quickly, but I have been known for my bad luck, so while I was rummaging through the remains of a Walmart scavenging for food my mother and sister were evaced to a nearby army base.</p><p> However, I have heard rumors among the small community of the "forgotten"(that's the name for us who were left behind) that the army only evacuated to kill everyone so that the disease would not spread.</p><p>I don't listen to their rumors, but this one makes me doubt that my mother and sister are alive.</p><p> Now I am on a mission to get through town and get to the forest so I can reunite with my family.</p><p> And NOTHING will stop me.</p>-->
